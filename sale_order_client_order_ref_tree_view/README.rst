=====================================


Overview
========

The **Sale Order Client Order Ref Tree View** module enhances the sale order management functionality in Odoo by adding the `client_order_ref` field to the sale order tree view. This addition helps users to easily view and manage client order references directly from the tree view of sale orders.
