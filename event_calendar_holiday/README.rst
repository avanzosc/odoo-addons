Event calendar holiday
======================

* This module allows you to associate holiday calendars, to the contracts
  associated with sales orders.
* By confirming the sales order, and generate the event's sessions, if the date
  of the session coincides with a day of holiday calendars defined in the sale
  contract, the "absence type" field defined in date calendar holidays, it will
  take to the session.
* The field "type of absence" is also defined in the model of "presence" of the
  sessions.
* When an employee is added to an event/session, it will take the "type of
  absence" from the session object, to the field "type of absence" of the
  object "presence". This "type of absence" of presence session, it will be
  updated in the calendar date of the employee.
