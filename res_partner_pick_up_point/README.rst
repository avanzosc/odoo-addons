=========================
Res Partner Pick Up Point
=========================

This module enhances the functionality of Odoo's Sales Orders by automatically setting the shipping address based on a designated "Pick Up Point" assigned to the customer. If a customer has a specific pick up point defined, that pick up point will be used as the shipping address for their orders.

Usage
-----

The module achieves this behavior through the following modifications to the `sale.order` model:

- **`onchange_partner_id` method**: This method is triggered whenever the `partner_id` field changes in the Sales Order form. It checks if the customer (`partner_id`) has a `pick_up_point_id` assigned. If so, it sets `partner_shipping_id` to this pick up point.

- **`create` method**: This method is overridden to intercept the creation of new Sales Orders (`sale.order`). If a `partner_id` is provided but `partner_shipping_id` is not specified, it checks if the associated partner (`res.partner`) has a `pick_up_point_id`. If yes, it assigns this pick up point as `partner_shipping_id`.

- **`write` method**: This method is overridden to handle updates to existing Sales Orders. If `partner_id` is included in the update and `partner_shipping_id` is not specified, it checks if the associated partner (`res.partner`) has a `pick_up_point_id`. If yes, it assigns this pick up point as `partner_shipping_id`.
