Fleet Route
===========

With this module you can define Routes, usually Bus Routes.

* A route will have a name and a direction (going or coming).
* It will be able to have many stops, and each stop can have a map location
* Many stops can share the same map location, as a stop is a location plus an
  estimated time in the route.


Each route can have:

* a vehicle
* a driver
* a manager and its substitutes
