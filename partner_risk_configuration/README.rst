==========================
Parnert Risk Configuration
==========================

* New check "Risk Unified" in partner form.
* When a new partner is created, the new field will take the same value as the
  one defined in "Account Settings".
* If this check is activated, the contacts and the parents risk will be unified
  and treated like if it is only one partner using only the risk defined in the
  parent company.
* When the check is not activated, each contact and each parent will be treated
  independently, each one with a especific risk.
