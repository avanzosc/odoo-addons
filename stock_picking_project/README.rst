Stock Picking Project
=====================

This module extends "Analytic Accounting for Stock Inventory" module allowing to assign
the picking to a specific task (related to the analytic account).

Take into account that the analytic line created when transferring the picking won't
have the project, as the system distinguishes analytic lines and timesheet by that
field.
