Account Renumber Options
========================

* New option in Account Setting Configuration, Renumber by period, this 
  field will be activated by default. When it is activated, the renumber 
  wizard will work as always. In the other hand if the check is not activated,
  the renumber wizard will not take into account the account move periods, 
  so the renumbering will be processed only by date. 

* In the renumber wizard, the secuence assignment is the same as in the base 
  process, so if the sequence is defined as "No gap" and there are gaps in 
  previous moves, is possible that the final moves sequences are not concurrent
  because some moves will be used to fill the gaps.
