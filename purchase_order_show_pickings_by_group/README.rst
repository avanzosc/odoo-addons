=====================================
Purchase Order Show Pickings By Group
=====================================

This module extends the default behavior of `purchase.order` to enhance the shortcut action `action_view_picking`. Instead of displaying only the pickings created from a specific purchase order, it shows **all `stock.picking` records that share the same `group_id`**.

- Overrides the `action_view_picking` method in `purchase.order`.
- Filters pickings based on shared `group_id`.
