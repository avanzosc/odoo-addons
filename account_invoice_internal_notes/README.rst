Account Move Internal Notes
===========================

This module adds an internal notes field to invoices (both customer and vendor), 
which can be edited even if the invoice is closed. The internal notes field is a free-text, 
multi-line field and is displayed in the invoice list view as a new column "Internal Notes".
