Purchase Contract Specification
===============================

This module allows the user to define a condition list for the purchase order. It
can be defined as a template of conditions. If a template is selected it's
conditions will be added to the purchase order, where they can be adapted to the
order. If template is changed the previous conditions won't be erased.

* Only the purchase manager is allowed to erase predefined conditions and templates.
