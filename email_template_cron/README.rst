===================
Email Template Cron
===================

This module allows scheduling the sending of email templates.

When installing this module a cron job is created to process the email
templates queue, it will send all those templates that have the check "Active
[cron]" set and "Next execution date" is previous than the current. By
default this cron is executed hourly.


Configuration
=============

In order to select which templates are going to be automatically and
periodically sent, user must configure each template by filling some fields:

* Active [cron] must be set True so the configurator in Advanced Settings tab.
* Configurator has 4 fields:
   * Interval number
   * Interval type
   * Next execution date
   * Domain, this will be applied in order to make a selection to the
     applied model.
     **Example**: [('state','=','draft'),('min_date','<',fields.Datetime.now
     ())] in a template applied to stock.picking model will send the email only
     in those pickings that are draft and scheduled date is previous than "now"
