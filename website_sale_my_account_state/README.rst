  - Adds a new column to the "My Quotations" page that displays the state of each quotation. This provides users with a clearer overview of their quotations' statuses.

- **State Information**:
  - The column displays the state of the quotation as one of the following:
    - **Draft**: The quotation is in draft status.
    - **Sent**: The quotation has been sent to the customer.
    - **Sale**: The quotation has been confirmed as a sale.
    - **Cancelled**: The quotation has been cancelled.


Usage
