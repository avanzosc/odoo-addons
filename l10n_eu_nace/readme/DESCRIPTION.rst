This module adds the concept of NACE activity to the partner.

NACE is the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European
Community. More info at http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-manuals-and-guidelines/-/KS-RA-07-015

Allows you to select in partner form:

* Main NACE activity in a dropdown (many2one)
* Secondary NACE activities in a multi label input (many2many)

This addon is inspired in OCA/community-data-files/l10n_eu_nace, but it does
not use partner categories to assign NACE activities to partner.
